Info
====

My Satoshis is a small web app that can be used to keep track of your bitcoin addresses on the go. It also shows the last transactions for that address.

It stores all the addresses you want to monitor in the local storage of your browser, so nothing is stored on a server anywhere.

The address balance comes directly from blockchain.info (not via this server) and the currency information from mtgox.com (cached for 5 mins).

All resources used in this app will be heavily cached by your mobile phone. After caching most data transfer will be to blockchain.info, which will be about 10KB per request.

Have fun!
